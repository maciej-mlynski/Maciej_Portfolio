## Maciej Młyński Profile

![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/me.png?raw=true)

In University I realized that learning is an essential part of life. I learned what relational database is and how it works, how to deal with dirty data, how to analyze it and how to build simple regression models. I know how much learning still lies ahead of me, but my main goal now is to find a job where I can prove my worth.

All of the courses I took included assignments to complete and texts to read. Therefore, the length of the courses is not a complete picture of the work I have done.

## My projects
I spent a lot of time doing my own projects. As it happens in life not everything works out as we would like it to. 
I try to make my projects ambitious and useful. Not all projects were finished because of the time I had, but it doesn't mean I won't come back to them. 


### [Project 1: Trader Vic Algorithm](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/TraderVicProject.git)

Determining trend lines can be very subjective. A properly drawn trend line can make a trader's job much easier. The project presents a tool that automatically draws trend, support and resistance lines based on techniques contained in a book called Trader Vic.

![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/TV.png?raw=true)

The image shows the trend lines and tunnel breaks automatically generated by the algorithm.
**Proces:**
1. Examines what occurred first. The local maximum or the minium. 
2. Draws long-term trend lines so that no point before the local peak is crossed.
3. Draws a tunnel starting from the intersection of the trend line to the lowest point of the candle.
4. Looks for intersection points of tunnels.
5. The third breakthrough of the line indicates a possible change or continuation of the trend, as in the image above.

**Notes:**
- The graph shows the period of discovery of the signals and what happened afterwards to test the effectiveness of the algorithm
- The way I drew the tunnels I presented earlier applies to the specific situation in the picture. There are definitely more possible conditions
- The algorithm also throws out relevant comments about the position trader should take

**The algorithm is not ready yet because it does not have all necessary conditions and does not have signals for closing the positions. In addition there is a capital management system which is not ready yet.**


### [Project 2: Login system & blog](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/FinancialMill-Maciej.git)

I have created a login system so that users can access our premium tools such as an ebook and credit calculator. The webside is aveliable [here](https://financialmill.pl/premium/index.php)
![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/LoginSys.png?raw=true)

**Description:**
1. Languages: PHP, HTML and CSS.
2. Users can sign in only by email.
3. User must pass reCaptcha verification.
4. User must agree to the terms of service.
5. User must verify email.
6. After Login user gets a discount on the ebook and access to the calculator.
7. User can delete account whenever he wants.

**Notes:**
I decided to use PHP because I didn't know at the time that there was such a thing as Django, where I could write everything with the familiar python syntax


### [Project 3: Mortgage-Calculator](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Mortgage-Calculator.git)

The calculator is not an ordinary tool to analyze credit costs. It is more of an interactive presentation that allows the user to understand and consciously choose how to optimize the cost of their mortgage. To see click [here](https://kalkulator-financialmill.herokuapp.com/)

activation code: FinancialMill2022

![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Calculator.png?raw=true)

**Description:**
1. Evaluates the impact of WIBOR 3M on a mortgage loan.
2. Counts the savings from the overpayment of the loan, taking into account the date the overpayments began and any indexation.
3. Counts the same as I mentioned earlier in the variant of regular investment of funds in order to pay off the mortgage once.
4. Calculates how much, for how long, and at what target percentage you should invest regularly so that the dividend value of your portfolio will cover your loan payment.
5. The calculator contains links to articles I have written and icons which expand to describe basic terms to help you understand the topic.

**Notes:**
I decided to use Streamlit, becouse it is easy to use. The problem is that whenever I wanted to do things my way, I usually encountered limitations and complications from Streamlit. I wanted to save some time thanks to Streamilt's automatic appearance creation, but at the end I waste more time by fixing the errors with catches and deployment.


### [Project 4: AdventureWork Sales](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/AdventureWorkProject.git)

The project can be divided into several stages:
1. Data collection.
2. Data transformation and cleaning. 
3. Grouping, joining and filtering.
4. Analysis and visualization of bicycle sales during the set periods.
5. Preparation of algorithm that estimate potential profits from new bike sales next year.

The project is quite long, so I will just present main things:

#### SQL Queries


		SELECT

			ps.Name,p.Color, p.Size,s.UnitPriceDiscount, DATEDIFF(MONTH, '2012-05-31', MONTH(sh.OrderDate) as MonthOfSale,
			FLOOR((DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(p.SellStartDate),MIN(sh.OrderDate))-1)/12) as YearsOfAveliability,
			MIN(p.Weight) as Weight, MIN(p.Class) as Class, AVG(p.StandardCost) as StanstadCost, MIN(p.ListPrice) as ListPrice, 
			s.UnitPrice * (1-s.UnitPriceDiscount) as FinalSellPrice , (s.UnitPrice * (1-s.UnitPriceDiscount))/AVG(p.StandardCost) as PriceToCost,
			SUM(s.OrderQty) as OrdersQuantity,
			'06.2012-06.2013' as YearsOfAnalyze
		FROM Production.Product as p
			JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail as s ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
			JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory as ps ON p.ProductSubcategoryID = ps.ProductSubcategoryID
			JOIN Production.ProductCategory as pc ON ps.ProductCategoryID = pc.ProductCategoryID
			JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader as sh ON s.SalesOrderID = sh.SalesOrderID
		WHERE pc.Name = 'Bikes' AND sh.OrderDate < COALESCE(p.SellEndDate, '2014-05-30') AND sh.OrderDate > '2012-05-30' AND sh.OrderDate <= '2013-05-29'
		GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((ps.Name, s.UnitPrice,s.UnitPriceDiscount, p.Size, p.Color, MONTH(sh.OrderDate)))
		ORDER BY ps.Name, p.Color, p.Size


**Results**:
1. I group sales by name, size and color becouse this makes up the key to creating an unique product name.
2. I group sales by unit price and discount becouse all bikes has been sold in few differen unit prices (3-4).
3. I group by months becouse of 2 reasons: The assortment changes in May and people has different shopping moods in relation to the season.
4. I drop all sales where order has been done after the bike has been withdrawn from production.
5. In PriceToCost column I count proportion of sale price to standard cost. I use that becouse it was a lot different prices, but the proportion was similar, so I could reduce feature twice.
6. I count Aveliability, to distinguish which one is new or old. There was no bike aveliable longer than 2 years.
7. This is one year of sales from May 2012 to May 2013. Why May? Becouse, shop change assortment this month.

#### Analysis
![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Analysis.png?raw=true)

**Conclusions:**
1. The chart shows the same bikes models sold in 2012-2013 and 2013-2014.
2. It is interesting to note that some bikes that sold well in 2012 were removed.
3. What is even more interesting is that the worst-selling models in 2012 sold at a satisfactory level in 2013. Of course, I mean the sales revenue.
4. The conclusion is that the store did not recall the worst-selling models. It removed those that were likely to be discontinued.
5. Through the analysis, I also realized that total sales profit does not reflect the full picture.
6. The store for large orders or when a product was about to be discontinued sold the bikes much lower than standard cost.


#### Prediction

Initially, I wanted to create an algorithm using logical regression to assess whether the product would bring an annual ROI of more or less than 5%.
**BUT**
After an analysis, that I outlined earlier. I understood that it would be more important for the company to estimate the number of units sold in a certain month, with a certain ratio of selling price to production cost.

##### Polly regression model Summary

|                  | R2 score  | Avg. sales (month) | MAE      | RMSE        
| -----------------| ----------|--------------------|----------|---------
| Train data       | 0.67174   | 30.96              | 10.56    | 15.23
| Test data        | 0.60022   | 29.24              | 11.9     | 16.82

**Coment:**...............................

### [Project 5: ETH wallet tracker by API compared to USD price](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/WalletTracker.git)

Etherscan API allows you to track transactions in any wallet account.
The tools can be useful if you would like to track the dollar value of a selected portfolio, for example. 

**To get the balance of a given ETH portfolio you need to:**
1. Download the transaction history.
2. Set your initial account balance to 0 ETH
3. add the purchase transactions by subtracting the gas price
4. Subtract sales transactions
5. Subtract any internal transactions, which usually represent the cost of creating your own smart account.

Once we have portfolio balance histories we encounter another problem. Namely, in order to compare the portfolio balance to the price of a fiat currency, let's say USD, we need to have the balance history in continuous form. 

The solution I created allowed the portfolio state to be rewritten until the next portfolio state change was identified.

![](https://github.com/maciej-mlynski/Maciej_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Tracker.png?raw=true)

Just as there is nothing to complain about when it comes to portfolio analysis, the tool has some noticeable flaws when it comes to tracking transactions. 
1. Tracker can see only 1000 day back
2. There are wallets, that has only negative transaction and balance is also negative. I guess that is becouse of the limited period of tracking.

**How to improve it?**

I think that the good idea is to reverse the proces if balance is negative:

1. First get the actuall balance (There is variable in API which can do that easly)
2. Then go back and subtract purchase transactions and add sales transactions
